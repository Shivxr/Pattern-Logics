# Pattern-Logics
research and various methods of printing patterns in python

# Traditional approach
    This is the Traditional coding approach of using nested loops that is two for loops for printing various star patterns.
    This approach is supported in every programming langauges and is highly recommended.
    Newbie may struggle to understand the working of the nested loops.
# String Multiplication approach
    This is a python feautured approach for pattern printing in multiple orders.
    String variable with the * and space is repeated i times to obtain the pattern.
    This is very easy to understand and compact of coding rookies to learn and apply.
# String Concatenation approach
    This is also a python assisted approach for pattern printing.
    String is continously concatenated with a reference variable with * to obtain the pattern.
    This is also compact and easy to learn.
# Slicing approach
    This is a approach which is only supported in python.
    String is multiplied outside the loop and substrings of the string is printed to obtain the pattern.
    Unlike other three approaches , this requires knowledge of slicing in python to implement the substrings.

# OVERALL TIME COMPLEXITY OF ALL APPROACHES : 0(N^2)

# CONCLUSION

In my research, the bare minimum time complexity for pattern printing is O(N^2) only.
All these approaches fall under the same time complexity but preference of the approach varies upon the choice of the user.
Traditional approach is optimal for Knowledged coders but few of the mentioned approaches are useful for the rookies or beginners.
Basic Knowledge over String operations assists the coders to implement pattern printing.
